## What is the HD500X?

The HD500X is an amazing device that enables guitarists to get the sound and effects they've alwaays wanted but in a single floor processor (say goodbye to all those Franken-pedals). With the click of a button, you can switch between sounding like Metallica, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Korn, John Mayer, and more. At $500, this device is a real bargain.

### What year is this? Are people still using the HD500X?

Hell yeah they are! When compared to the Helix series at over 3X the cost, the HD500X brings as good as a performance at a faction of the price.

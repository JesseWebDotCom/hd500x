## Important
I play with an Line 6 HD500xx, JTV-89F, and StageSource L2t - and that's it. This is an all digital setup (no 1/4 guitar cords used). This allows me to dynamicaly set the sound of my effects, amp, guitar, and even tuning with the click of a button. It also allows me to get the exact sounds I want (ex. Korn's 7 string Ibanez K7 with special tuning, Bon Jovi's 12 string acoustic Ovation, etc.). Its pretty cool.

So what does this mean for you? 

* If you atleast have an HD500X amd James Tyler Variax guitar, the presets should work and sound perfect to a clean /pre-amp or board.
* If you only have the HD500x, you may need to ensure INPUT 1 SOURCE in Pod HD500X Edit includes "Guitar" as well as tweaking the sounds for your specific setup.
